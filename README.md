There is no much user interaction since i was using C++. To try the program, you have to open it as an IDE project (I used codeblocks).
Go to the code asking for image input and type a suib=table path for an available image then run it.
PS: make sure you have incorporated your IDE with OpenCV and ningW compiler and libraries.
